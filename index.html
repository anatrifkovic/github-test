              Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
            show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who
            make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if
            they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
            television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one
            of the ones that became nothing.</p>
            <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
            chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
            transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.
            But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides,
            I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case
            to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
